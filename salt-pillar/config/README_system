# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYSTEMS ARE COLLECTIONS OF INSTANCES CONFIGURED WITH DIFFERENT ROLES BEING PROVISIONED AND 
# DEPLOYED AS ONE LOGICAL UNIT THAT CAN BE MANAGED OPERATIONAL AS A SINGLE UNIT.
# 
# CLUSTER TYPE ROLES CAN HAVE ANY NUMBER OF MEMBERS DEFINED, HOWEVER, UNLESS USING 'default'
# THE TOTAL MEMBERS WILL INCLUDE ONE PRIMARY AND N -1 SECONDARY
#
# MULTIPLE CLUSTERS CAN BE PROVISIONED AS PART OF A SYSTEM, BUT ONLY ONE CLUSTER OF EACH CLUSTER ROLE TYPE
# PER SYSTEM
#
# SPECIAL SALT GRAIN WILL BE ADDED TO EACH INSTANCE WITHIN THE SYSTEM
# FOR TARGETING PURPOSES
#
# PRODUCTGROUP.SYSTEM.NAME: system_name
# PRODUCTGROUP.SYSTEM.ID: salt environment unique autogenerated system ID based on product.group and system name
#
# EXAMPLE:
# devops.system.name: small_test
# devops.system.id: 9
# cloud.system.id: 1
#
# we want cloud.system.id grain to be unique throughout the salt environment. 
#
# yaml scheme:
#
# system.productgroupname
#   productgroup.system.systemname
#     clusterrolename:
#       members: [num | default]   
#     nonclusterrolename
#       count: [num | default]
#
# If default is specified for either members (use for cluster type roles) or count (use for non cluster type roles)
# The values specific in the provisioning/templates/... pillar will be used.
